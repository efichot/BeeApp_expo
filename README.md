# Imformations

- Inside the `./platform` folder you can find the ts files specific to the platform web or mobile. (the web.ts are handle by webpack for `yarn run web` command).
- Inside the `./assets` folder the images are in 3 resolutions for targeting the different resolutions of the screens (@1x, @2x, @3x), only the images without a @ in the name are imported for the web.
- `global.css` all the global style you want to apply
